For daily commit.

Too late update...
I have to update two days.

In day 0008,

I finished to make segment and page structure. However, it took too long time with load query and got segmenatatio fault... I did not know what was thw problem and how to fix it. By the way, I successfully changed my data structure from sigle array to segment and page which will make me easier with implementing insert and join query.



In day 0009,

I worked with the select query based on segment and page. It still got segmentation fault when I tried to get the values. I have to fixed it as soon as possible to get progress with insert and join queries.
Additionally, I  also fixed my problem with load query. The problem was there, #define. I declared maximum row counts a segement can contain and max data size a page affordable with #define and it made me get those values as  char\* type... So I changed the declarations as const int, and it make me spend extremely short time with load query.


My codes are [here].
