For daily commit.
The First thing is this, Jekyll Blog.
I just follow [this post], so I need to study more about jekyll.

With this blog, I will post about my daily commits which will be about various subjects. And the First subject might be Database because I am going to make my own toy DB.

And also, this look like being a big help for my english.
