For daily commit.

In this time I change the input as a query format. However, only restricted commands are provided. The followings are the provided queries.

    1. create <table> <input.csv> <table name>
    2. select <column1> from <table name> [where <column2> <operator> <value>]
    3. list
    4. quit

With the select query, column1 only provide "all(\*)" and column2 only provides "total price".


The followings are things to do.(For those, I will mention about only the functions not in query format)

    1. create database
    2. loosen the restrictions with select query
    3. with 1. implement list query to be able to list tables in selected database

The second one might be a hard one...


The codes are commited [here].
