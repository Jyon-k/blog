For daily commit.

I fixed the wrong indexing. However, now I get some errors with select process. A specific Segment-Page-Record returns segmentation fault. But I do not know why... As load process there is no reason the record is empty. So, I have to deal with load process again maybe.

으어아으아에...

I'll commit [my code] for day0012 tomorrow.
