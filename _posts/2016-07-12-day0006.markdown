For daily commit.

I partially finished the work with select query. Now I can use the following select query.

    1. select all from <table name> [where <column name> <operator> <value>]

The next things I will try to do are as the followings

    1. select specific column with select query
    2. insert query

The second one might be hard work. Beacuse it is supposed to change a large part of existing code... So, I will try it with enough time(about a week, because I do not deal with my code through weekends). However, The first one looks simple and I can handle it in short time(about 1 or 2 days).

Additionally, I still not good at using github, so I couldn't upload my day0006 code. I will find the way as soon as possible.
