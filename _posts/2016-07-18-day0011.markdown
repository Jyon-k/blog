Late upload...

I still get error with load process. Actually it give me run-time error, so I take a little long time to the error occurs at load not select. After checking segment, page and record index, I get the error is caused by load process. It looks might take not short time to resilve it. So, my plan about insert and join process may take a little more time.

Not many things to post.
