For daily commit.

Today,I finished the most basic things. Now I can use select query for specific columns. The followings are what I have done.

    1. general create query
    2. general load query
    3. general select query

And what I will try to do are

    1. insert query
    2. join query

However, before implementing insert query, I need to change my data structure. Now I use just a single array for the table, and I is not good for insert and memory management. So, I will re-instruct the memory unit to make them easier.

My plan of data structure is as follows.

    1. Page which has record table
    2. Segment which has page pointer array
    3. Table get array of segment

The page will be the unit of memory allocation and segment will be the unit of memory management.

It looks there are a lot of things to do including fix already implmented codes such as select query and load query. So it might take a little long time. And I will try to finish it in this week.

Additionally, finally I commit my code on [my github]. Now I can use merge haha...
