For daily commit.

Today, I fixed indexing again... wow... endless index fixing...

So, today I will post the result of indexing

    1. Current Segment Index = (row count) / (max records per segment)
    2. Current Page Index = ((row count) - (curSegIndex) * (segMaxRec)) / (max records per page)
    3. Current Record Index = ((row count) - (curSegIndex) * (segMaxRec) - (curPageIndex) * (pageMaxRec)) % (pageMaxRec)

If it is wrong again... hmm... I might need to calculate with small examples or get some advice from other people haha...
Wow, the insert and join process will take forever~~~~

I won't commit today again because except the indexing I did not change anything.
