For daily commit.

Today, I implement more with query style inputs.
I tried to use the following queries additionally.

    1. create table <table name> <column type> <column name>
    2. load <table name> with <input.csv>
    3. select <column name> from <table name> with [<column name> <operator> <value>]

However, I stuck in the second one. With that I got segmentation fault.
Tomorrow, I will fix it.

Additionally, I could not commit today's code becasue I am not used to using github...

Too many things to study...
