For daily commit.

As I planed first, I do not commit through weekend... However, I have to boost up my implementation, I work with my code on Sunday...haha...

At first, I finally finish making select query with new data structer... but there are some errors with loading large file... And I found where the problem is! As I coded, I store one record with one page and it may occur heap overflow.

However, I got the error code which means I do memory allocation twice. So, today night and tomorrow I have to see my codes more.

After I fix them, insert might not be a big problem but join might not be that easy...

[Here's] my codes.
